# Warehouse TSP Enhancement - Rack Visualization Update

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary of Changes

Successfully updated the main `warehouse_tsp.py` entry point to use the new enhanced graph construction with rack inference and added rack polygon visualization.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. **Rack Polygon Visualization** (`legacy/visualization_enhanced.py`)

New visualization module that displays detected racks as colored polygons:

**Features:**
- ✅ **Rack Polygons**: Shows the physical extent of each detected rack
- ✅ **Rack Pair Coloring**: Opposite-facing rack pairs use matching colors
- ✅ **Semi-transparent Overlays**: Racks shown as colored regions (15-20% alpha)
- ✅ **Bounding Box Calculation**: Automatically computes rack extent from bins
- ✅ **Route Visualization**: Overlays optimized path on top of rack structures

**Key Functions:**
```python
get_rack_polygons(locs)          # Generate polygon coordinates for each rack
get_rack_pairs(locs)             # Identify opposite-facing rack pairs
visualize_graph_with_racks(...)  # Graph view with rack overlays
visualize_route_with_racks(...)  # Route view with rack overlays
```

### 2. **Updated Main Entry Point** (`warehouse_tsp.py`)

Completely rewired to use the enhanced system:

**Before:**
- Used legacy coordinate-based OR physical layout system
- Format detection to choose which system
- No rack inference
- Basic visualization

**After:**
- **Always uses enhanced graph construction** with automatic rack inference
- Unified approach for all warehouse JSON files
- Rack-aware routing by default
- Enhanced visualizations with rack polygons
- Removed dependency on `physical/` modules

**New Flow:**
```
1. Load warehouse JSON → DataFrame
2. Detect aisles using DBSCAN clustering
3. Infer rack structures from bin positions
4. Build enhanced graph (respects rack barriers)
5. Solve TSP with Christofides algorithm
6. Visualize with rack polygons overlaid
```

## Testing Results

### Small Warehouse Test
```bash
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations.json data/picks_small_test.txt --visualize both --no-display
```

**Results:**
- ✅ 24 nodes, 34 edges (fully connected)
- ✅ 5 racks detected, 2 pairs identified
- ✅ 8 picks optimized: 225.3 units total distance
- ✅ Graph and route visualizations generated successfully

### Large Warehouse Test
```bash
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations_large.json data/picks_large_test.txt --visualize both --no-display --stats
```

**Results:**
- ✅ 171 nodes, 245 edges (fully connected)
- ✅ 12 racks detected, 6 pairs identified
- ✅ 20 picks optimized: 1,830.6 units total distance
- ✅ Rack polygons clearly visible in visualization
- ✅ Route respects physical rack barriers

## Visualization Examples

### Graph View with Racks
**File:** `output/warehouse_graph_graph.png`

Shows:
- All warehouse nodes (picking, staging, docks, intersections)
- Graph edges (blue lines showing connections)
- **Rack polygons** in colored semi-transparent overlays
- Rack pairs use matching color schemes
- Non-traversable obstacles in red

### Route View with Racks
**File:** `output/warehouse_solution_route.png`

Shows:
- **Rack polygons** (lighter, more transparent)
- Optimized route path (red line with arrows)
- Pick locations highlighted as green stars with sequence numbers
- Start location (blue diamond)
- All nodes dimmed (gray) for context
- Route navigates around physical rack barriers

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (with rack visualization)
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations.json data/picks_small_test.txt
```

### Show Both Graph and Route
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations_large.json data/picks_large_test.txt --visualize both
```

### Graph Only (no TSP solving)
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations.json data/picks_small_test.txt --visualize graph
```

### With Detailed Statistics
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations_large.json data/picks_large_test.txt --stats
```

### Save Without Displaying
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations.json data/picks_small_test.txt --no-display --output my_route.png
```

### Custom Start/End Points
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py data/warehouse_locations.json data/picks_small_test.txt --start Staging_1 --end Dock_Shipping
```

## Technical Implementation

### Rack Polygon Algorithm

```python
For each detected rack:
    1. Get all bins belonging to this rack
    2. Calculate bounding box:
       min_x = min(bin.x - bin.width/2)
       max_x = max(bin.x + bin.width/2)
       min_y = min(bin.y - bin.depth/2)
       max_y = max(bin.y + bin.depth/2)
    3. Create rectangular polygon from corners
    4. Assign color based on rack pairing
```

### Rack Pair Detection

```python
For each left-side rack:
    For each right-side rack:
        If y-coordinates similar (< 30 units apart):
            If x-coordinate indicates opposite sides:
                Mark as paired rack
```

### Visualization Layers (bottom to top)

1. **Rack Polygons** (filled, semi-transparent)
2. **Graph Edges** (thin blue lines)
3. **Obstacles** (red rectangles)
4. **Route Path** (thick red line with arrows)
5. **All Nodes** (small gray circles)
6. **Pick Locations** (large green stars with numbers)
7. **Start/End** (blue diamond / purple square)

## Files Modified

### New Files
1. **`legacy/visualization_enhanced.py`** - Rack polygon visualization module (300+ lines)

### Updated Files
1. **`warehouse_tsp.py`** - Main entry point now uses enhanced system (220 lines)
   - Removed legacy/physical format detection
   - Always uses enhanced graph construction
   - Integrated rack visualization
   - Simplified and streamlined

## Benefits

### Before
- ❌ Multiple code paths (legacy vs physical)
- ❌ Format detection complexity
- ❌ No rack visualization
- ❌ Basic graph plots
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior

### After
- ✅ Single unified code path
- ✅ Automatic rack detection and visualization
- ✅ Clear visual representation of physical constraints
- ✅ Easier to understand routing behavior
- ✅ Consistent across all warehouse files
- ✅ Better debugging (can see racks blocking paths)

## Performance

| Metric | Small Warehouse | Large Warehouse |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Graph Build | 0.07s | 2.32s |
| TSP Solve | 0.00s | 0.03s |
| Visualization | 0.5s | 1.2s |
| **Total Time** | **< 1s** | **< 4s** |

Rack polygon rendering adds minimal overhead (~0.1s per visualization).
