# Multi-Floor Visualization Update

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

---

## Overview

Updated multi-floor warehouse visualization to generate **separate visualizations per floor** instead of a single unified graph. This makes multi-floor warehouses much easier to understand and analyze.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Floor-Separated Visualizations**

Instead of creating one confusing unified graph showing all floors at once, the system now creates:

- **One graph per floor**: `warehouse_graph_floor1.png`, `warehouse_graph_floor2.png`, etc.
- **One route per floor**: `warehouse_route_floor1.png`, `warehouse_route_floor2.png`, etc.

### 2. **Per-Floor Statistics**

Each floor now shows:
- Number of nodes visited
- Number of picks collected
- Distance traveled on that floor only
- Which visualization files were generated

### 3. **Fixed Invalid Colors**

Replaced non-standard matplotlib colors:
- `darkgreen` â†’ `forestgreen`
- `darkblue` â†’ `navy`
- `darkpurple` â†’ `indigo`

---

## Example Output

```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py --warehouse-layout data/warehouse_floor1.json data/warehouse_floor2.json data/picks.txt --visualize both
```

```
======================================================================
GENERATING PER-FLOOR VISUALIZATIONS
======================================================================

Floor 1:
  Nodes visited: 20
  Picks: 9
  Distance: 246.4 units
  Generating graph visualization...
  Saved: output/warehouse_graph_floor1.png
  Generating route visualization...
  Saved: output/warehouse_route_floor1.png

Floor 2:
  Nodes visited: 0
  Picks: 0
  Distance: 0.0 units
  Generating graph visualization...
  Saved: output/warehouse_graph_floor2.png
```

---

## Benefits

### âœ… **Clarity**
- Each floor is shown clearly without clutter from other floors
- Easy to see the layout and structure of each level
- No overlapping nodes or confusing edge crossings

### âœ… **Analysis**
- Can compare floor layouts side-by-side
- See exactly which picks are on which floor
- Understand distance traveled per floor

### âœ… **Scalability**
- Works equally well for 2 floors or 20 floors
- Each floor gets its own clear visualization
- No visualization becomes too complex

### âœ… **Flexibility**
- Can visualize just graph: `--visualize graph`
- Can visualize just route: `--visualize route`
- Can visualize both: `--visualize both`
- Each generates separate files per floor

---

## File Naming Convention

### Graph Visualizations
```
output/warehouse_graph_floor1.png
output/warehouse_graph_floor2.png
output/warehouse_graph_floor3.png
...
```

### Route Visualizations
```
output/warehouse_route_floor1.png
output/warehouse_route_floor2.png
output/warehouse_route_floor3.png
...
```

---

## Technical Details

### Implementation

The visualization logic now:

1. **Iterates through each floor** separately
2. **Filters route and picks** to only include nodes on that floor
3. **Uses per-floor graph** (not the unified multi-floor graph)
4. **Calculates per-floor distance** by summing edges within the floor
5. **Generates visualization** with proper floor-specific labels

### Key Code Changes

**Location:** `warehouse_tsp.py` lines 434-475

```python
# Create visualization for each floor separately
for floor_num in sorted(warehouse.floors.keys()):
    floor_locs = warehouse.floors[floor_num]
    floor_graph = warehouse.floor_graphs[floor_num]
    
    # Filter route to only include nodes on this floor
    floor_prefix = f'F{floor_num}_'
    floor_route = [node for node in route if node.startswith(floor_prefix)]
    floor_picks = [node for node in pick_order if node.startswith(floor_prefix)]
    
    # Generate visualizations with floor-specific data
    visualize_graph_with_racks(floor_locs, floor_graph, ...)
    visualize_route_with_racks(floor_locs, floor_graph, floor_route, ...)
```

### Edge Cases Handled

- **Floors with no picks**: Still generates graph visualization (no route visualization)
- **Floors not visited**: Shows empty floor layout
- **Display mode**: Respects `--no-display` flag per floor
- **Custom output paths**: Still allows user-specified output directory

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Floor with Both Visualizations
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py --warehouse-layout floor1.json floor2.json picks.txt --visualize both
```

### Multi-Floor Graph Only (No Routes)
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py --warehouse-layout floor1.json floor2.json picks.txt --visualize graph
```

### Multi-Floor Route Only (No Graphs)
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py --warehouse-layout floor1.json floor2.json picks.txt --visualize route
```

### Multi-Floor with No Display (Files Only)
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py --warehouse-layout floor1.json floor2.json picks.txt --visualize both --no-display
```

### Three Floors
```powershell
python warehouse_tsp.py --warehouse-layout floor1.json floor2.json floor3.json picks.txt --visualize both
# Generates: floor1.png, floor2.png, floor3.png for both graph and route
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### âœ… Single-Floor Mode Unchanged
```powershell
# Still works exactly as before
python warehouse_tsp.py warehouse.json picks.txt --visualize both
```

Single-floor mode continues to generate:
- `output/warehouse_graph.png`
- `output/warehouse_solution.png`

### âœ… All CLI Arguments Supported
- `--visualize graph|route|both|none`
- `--no-display`
- `--output DIRECTORY`
- `--stats`

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions

1. **Floor Transition Indicators**
   - Show where route transitions between floors
   - Highlight access points (stairs/elevators)
   - Draw arrows indicating floor changes

2. **Combined Summary View**
   - Optional single-page overview with small multiples
   - Side-by-side floor comparison
   - Statistical summary panel

3. **Interactive Visualization**
   - HTML/JavaScript output with floor selector
   - Zoom and pan per floor
   - Toggle between floors dynamically

4. **3D Stacked View**
   - Optional 3D visualization showing floors stacked vertically
   - Rotate/zoom to see from different angles
   - Inter-floor connections visible in 3D space

## Conclusion

The new floor-separated visualization approach provides:

âœ… **Much clearer visualization** of multi-floor warehouses  
âœ… **Per-floor statistics** for better analysis  
âœ… **Scalable to many floors** without visual clutter  
âœ… **Easy to compare** floor layouts side-by-side  
âœ… **Backward compatible** with single-floor mode  

The multi-floor visualization system is now production-ready and user-friendly! ðŸŽ‰
