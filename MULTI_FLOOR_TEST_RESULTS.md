## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Balanced Distribution (3 picks per floor)
**Pick List:** `picks_test1_balanced.txt`
```
Floor 1: A1-4, A2-4, C2-3
Floor 2: B1-5, B2-5, C1-4
```

**Results:**

| Strategy | Total Distance | Floor Transitions | Waypoints | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Unified** | 1411.8u | 1 | 30 | Includes 1000u penalty |
| **Per-Floor** | 1232.2u | 1 | 17 | Optimizes each floor separately |

**Analysis:**
- Per-floor strategy is **179.6u (13%) better** when accounting for true distance
- Unified: 411.8u actual travel + 1000u penalty
- Per-floor: 232.2u actual travel (182.8u Floor 1 + 49.4u Floor 2) + 1000u penalty
- Per-floor has 43% fewer waypoints (more efficient path)

**Zone Distribution:**
- Floor 1: 2 picks Zone A, 1 pick Zone C
- Floor 2: 2 picks Zone B, 1 pick Zone C

---

### Test 2: Single Floor (Floor 1 only - 6 picks)
**Pick List:** `picks_test2_floor1_only.txt`
```
Floor 1: A1-4, A2-4, B1-3, C1-3, C2-3, A1-3
Floor 2: None
```

**Results:**

| Strategy | Total Distance | Floor Transitions | Waypoints | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Unified** | 292.8u | 0 | 22 | No floor change needed |
| **Per-Floor** | 256.8u | 0 | 20 | More efficient routing |

**Analysis:**
- Per-floor strategy is **36u (12%) better** even on single floor
- No inter-floor penalty applies (no floor changes)
- Both strategies correctly identify all picks on Floor 1
- Unified has slightly more waypoints due to graph complexity

**Zone Distribution:**
- Floor 1: 3 picks Zone A, 1 pick Zone B, 2 picks Zone C

---

### Test 3: Mixed Distribution (3 picks per floor)
**Pick List:** `picks_test3_floor2_only.txt`
```
Floor 1: A1-1, A2-1, B1-1
Floor 2: B1-5, B2-5, C1-4
```

**Results:**

| Strategy | Total Distance | Floor Transitions | Waypoints | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Unified** | 1273.4u | 1 | 20 | Includes 1000u penalty |
| **Per-Floor** | 1125.8u | 1 | 10 | Half the waypoints! |

**Analysis:**
- Per-floor strategy is **147.6u (12%) better**
- Unified: 273.4u actual travel + 1000u penalty
- Per-floor: 125.8u actual travel (76.4u Floor 1 + 49.4u Floor 2) + 1000u penalty
- Per-floor achieves 50% fewer waypoints - significantly more direct routing
- Floor 2's Zone B density (5 picks per rack) shows value in per-floor optimization

**Zone Distribution:**
- Floor 1: 2 picks Zone A, 1 pick Zone B
- Floor 2: 2 picks Zone B, 1 pick Zone C

## Key Findings

### 1. **Per-Floor Strategy Consistently Outperforms Unified**

Across all tests, the per-floor approach yielded **12-13% shorter actual travel distances**:

| Test Scenario | Unified Distance | Per-Floor Distance | Improvement |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------| ------------|
| Balanced (3+3) | 411.8u | 232.2u | **179.6u (44%)** |
| Floor 1 Only (6) | 292.8u | 256.8u | **36u (12%)** |
| Mixed (3+3) | 273.4u | 125.8u | **147.6u (54%)** |

*Note: Inter-floor penalty (1000u) not included in percentages*

### 2. **Waypoint Efficiency**

Per-floor strategy generates significantly fewer waypoints:

- Test 1: 30 ‚Üí 17 waypoints (**43% reduction**)
- Test 2: 22 ‚Üí 20 waypoints (**9% reduction**)
- Test 3: 20 ‚Üí 10 waypoints (**50% reduction**)

**Why this matters:**
- Fewer waypoints = smoother, more direct routes
- Less decision-making for warehouse workers
- Reduced cognitive load
- Faster picking times in practice

### 3. **Floor Transition Behavior**

Both strategies correctly minimize floor transitions:
- When picks span 2 floors: **1 transition** (optimal)
- When picks on 1 floor only: **0 transitions** (optimal)

The 1000-unit inter-floor penalty effectively ensures TSP completes all picks on one floor before moving to the next.

### 4. **Zone Density Impact**

Floor 2's expanded Zone B (10 picks vs 8 on Floor 1) demonstrates:
- Dense zones benefit from per-floor optimization
- Local optimization finds tighter routes within dense pick areas
- Unified graph may over-optimize for global minimum at expense of local efficiency

### 5. **Scalability Implications**

As warehouse complexity increases:
- **Unified approach:** Graph size grows quadratically (O(n¬≤) edges)
  - 2 floors, ~28 nodes each = 54 nodes, potential ~1400 edges
  - TSP complexity: O(n¬≥) on full graph
  
- **Per-floor approach:** Linear scaling per floor
  - Each floor: 28 nodes, ~30 edges
  - TSP complexity: 2 √ó O(28¬≥) << O(54¬≥)
  - **Computational advantage increases with more floors**

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ **Use Per-Floor Strategy When:**
- Multiple floors with significant pick counts on each floor
- Dense pick zones within each floor
- Computational resources are limited
- Simplicity and predictability are priorities
- Need guaranteed minimal floor transitions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consider Unified Strategy When:**
- Very sparse picks (1-2 per floor)
- Cross-floor route optimization might save significant distance
- Willing to accept computational overhead for potential global optimum
- Academic/research purposes requiring true optimal solution

### üéØ **Best Practice: Per-Floor as Default**

Based on test results:
1. **12-54% distance savings** in actual travel
2. **34% fewer waypoints** on average
3. **Faster computation** (smaller subproblems)
4. **More predictable** routing behavior
5. **Easier to debug** and understand

**The per-floor sequential strategy should be the default for production use.**

## Visualization Examples

### Test 1: Balanced Distribution

**Floor 1 Route:**
- Starts at Staging_1
- Visits A1-4, A2-4, C2-3
- 18 waypoints, 232.8 units

**Floor 2 Route:**
- Continues from floor transition point
- Visits B1-5, B2-5, C1-4
- 12 waypoints, 179.0 units

Separate floor visualizations make it clear which picks belong to which floor, eliminating confusion.

## Future Testing Ideas

### Additional Test Scenarios

1. **Heavy Imbalance (1 pick Floor 1, 15 picks Floor 2)**
   - Test extreme distribution scenarios
   - Measure when unified might consider skipping floor penalty

2. **3+ Floors**
   - Test scalability with vertical expansion
   - Multiple transition points
   - Sequential vs. optimal floor ordering

3. **Different Inter-Floor Penalties**
   - Test 500u, 2000u, 5000u penalties
   - Find optimal penalty for different warehouse types
   - Model real elevator/stair times

4. **Dynamic Penalties Based on Distance**
   - Penalty = f(distance_from_transition_point)
   - Model realistic warehouse worker behavior

5. **Time-Based Optimization**
   - Convert distance to time
   - Include elevator wait times
   - Model congestion at transition points
